# AK47: A DDoS Simulation Tool

# Introduction:
# AK47 is a Python-based DDoS simulation tool designed for educational purposes only. This tool is intended to help students and researchers understand the concepts of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and their impact on network security. AK47 provides a controlled environment to simulate various types of DDoS attacks, allowing users to analyze and develop mitigation strategies.

# Features:

TCP Flood Attack: Simulates a TCP flood attack using crafted HTTP packets
UDP Flood Attack: Simulates a UDP flood attack using random data packets
ICMP Flood Attack: Simulates an ICMP flood attack using ICMP echo request packets
Multi-Threading: Supports multiple threads for each attack type, allowing for increased traffic simulation
Customizable: Allows users to specify target IP, port, and number of threads for each attack
Disclaimer:
This tool is for educational purposes only. Using AK47 or any other DDoS simulation tool to conduct actual DDoS attacks is strictly prohibited and may be illegal in your jurisdiction. The author of this tool will not be responsible for any misuse or consequences arising from the use of AK47.
